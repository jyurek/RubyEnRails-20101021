!SLIDE

# People who test

!SLIDE

# People who don't test

!SLIDE

# People who want to test, but can't

!SLIDE

# In the beginning...

!SLIDE

# We were never taught testing in school!

!SLIDE

# This is crazy-talk!

!SLIDE

# Testing is like version control
## Completely unsexy, but critical

!SLIDE

# No one ever told me this.
## Either one, actually.

!SLIDE

# Turns out, they're pretty similar

!SLIDE

# An old directory of mine...

    new-site/
    old-site-20030401/
    old-site/
    site-backup/
    site/

# Shut up, you did that too.

!SLIDE

# Try getting someone who's never used version control to use it

!SLIDE

# Try getting someone on CVS to use git

!SLIDE

# Huge slowdown
# Procedural difference
# We fear change
