# ... and didn't test.

!SLIDE

# Who was taught testing in school?
# Who was taught version control in school?
# &nbsp;
## We sure weren't.

!SLIDE

# We didn't have any arguments against it yet.
## It wasn't a thing to be argued against.
## We just didn't do it.

!SLIDE

# Ok, that's not completely true.
## We thought it was dull and useless.

!SLIDE

# We were hackers. Explorers. Tinkerers.

!SLIDE

# We got into testing because we got into Ruby and Rails
## The testing culture of the community really pushed us.

!SLIDE

# It used to be that your Rails coming of age was a blog.

!SLIDE

# Then it seemed to become a testing framework.

!SLIDE

# We have lots of testing tools and utilities.

!SLIDE

# test/unit
# RSpec
# Shoulda
# minitest
# bacon
# cucumber
# steak
# test/spec

!SLIDE

# factory_girl
# machinist
# fixture scenarios
# mocha
# sham-rack
# capybara
# _and a whole lot more_

!SLIDE

# We've become big proponents of TDD.

!SLIDE

# We've given back to the testing community.
## We really believe in this.
## We want others to, too.

!SLIDE

# We started with what Rails gave us.

!SLIDE

# Unit tests.
## They work, but they're limited.

!SLIDE

# Functional tests.
## Well, Rails' functional tests are more like small integration tests.

!SLIDE

# Then we found cucumber.

!SLIDE

# What? Plain text?
## I had a lot of reservations, especially when it was the "RSpec story runner".

!SLIDE

# Ok, I hated it, and the idea.
## I came around.

!SLIDE

# Rails Rumble 2009
## Nothing but cucumber, even the git parts.

!SLIDE

# Since then, mostly cucumber.
## Unit and functional where needed.

!SLIDE

# Fakes are great for more complex trickery
## Sham-rack, endpoints that act like the real thing.

!SLIDE

# Outside-in Development is the real way forward.

!SLIDE

# Pet Peeve: Don't write your integration tests like your unit tests.

!SLIDE

# Get as high level a story as you possibly can, using real, descriptive language.
## Steps are more than just long-winded method calls.

!SLIDE

# Some people have time constraints, and think they can sacrifice tests.

!SLIDE

# Code may be a liability, but tests are a mitigation.
## And technical debt buildup must be repaid.

!SLIDE

# If you *really* don't have time, write the code without tests.
## But once you have time, toss it and rewrite.

!SLIDE

# Some people don't know what thir code should be or how it works.

!SLIDE

# Write it, to prove the concept.
## Then toss it out and write it again.

!SLIDE

# Writing it lets you get an idea.
## Tossing it forces you to TDD it.

!SLIDE

# Code is communication.
## Tests are even moreso.

!SLIDE

# Tests will tell you how the coder thinks about his code.

!SLIDE

# I always look at a code's tests first.

!SLIDE

# I always ask job candidates about testing experience.

!SLIDE

# These things are important to us.

!SLIDE

# There are a _lot_ of places that don't test.
## No, a _lot_.

!SLIDE

# There's a pretty good chance you're working for one.

!SLIDE

# A lot of talks at a lot of conferences are about testing.
## (Including this one)

!SLIDE

# Paperclip has 2796 GitHub watchers.
## Still clinging to the top 10.

!SLIDE

# RSpec has 1600.
## Shoulda's not even on the list.

!SLIDE

# People talk about testing way more than they test.

!SLIDE

# There's a hidden detail...

!SLIDE

# You're all testing.
## Just not efficiently, and not TDD.

!SLIDE

# Even the person who doesn't know where to start.

!SLIDE

# Even big companies with waterfall methodologies have QA Departments.

!SLIDE

# No project is ever not tested at all.
## If nothing else, using it is a test.

!SLIDE

# We're all scientists.
## We're in Computer Science.
## We use the scientific method.

!SLIDE

# Start with a hypothesis.

!SLIDE

# Come up with a test to prove or disprove it.

!SLIDE

# Run it with a control.

!SLIDE

# Determine Results.

!SLIDE

# ... Profit!

!SLIDE

# The hypothesis states your problem. Even "I should be able to log in."
## Doesn't sound very exciting, saying it like that.

!SLIDE

# "The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution." - Bertrand Russell

!SLIDE

# Writing the tests explicitly states a solvable problem and its confirmation.
## This is harder than writing the solution.

!SLIDE

# Running it with a control means watching it fail.
## It's important to know your tests are doing what they say.
## You're testing your tests this way.

!SLIDE

# Make it green, and you have your result.
## If you can't, rethink your test.

!SLIDE

# All of this is done the same way whether your automate or not.
## Browser tests are still tests.
## QA, too. They're just bad for quick feedback.

!SLIDE

# We need to make code better.

# Testing is how we refactor.

!SLIDE

# Refactoring is how we make code better.

!SLIDE

# Refactoring code means you can change the inside without the outside caring.
## Requires "Black-box" testing.

!SLIDE

# We owe it to ourselves and our profession to promote automated testing.

!SLIDE

# Come up with crazy ideas.

!SLIDE

# Crazy ideas like running Javascript in Ruby.
## Well, it exists, but...

!SLIDE

# Crazy ideas like automated HTML/CSS tests.

!SLIDE

# Crazy ideas like a CPAN Tester Network.
## Distributed CI network.

!SLIDE

# Ok, it's not that crazy since it exists. But not for gems.

!SLIDE

# Projects without tests need public shaming.

!SLIDE

# We _don't_ use plugins and gems without tests.
## We'll write tests for them if we have to.

# Thank You.
