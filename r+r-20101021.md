# ... and didn't test.

!SLIDE

# Oh, we test now, sure.
## Everyone starts somewhere.

!SLIDE

# Who was taught testing in school?
# Who was taught version control in school?
# &nbsp;
## We sure weren't.

!SLIDE

# We didn't have any arguments against it yet.
## It wasn't a thing to be argued against.
## We just didn't do it.

!SLIDE

# We were hackers. Explorers. Tinkerers.

!SLIDE

# We found Rails and decided to make a big jump.
## Not just _to_ Rails, but _away_ from hackery.

!SLIDE

# We got into testing because we got into Ruby and Rails
## The testing culture of the community really pushed us.

!SLIDE

# It used to be that your Rails coming of age was a blog.

!SLIDE

# Then it beame a testing framework.

!SLIDE

# We have *so many* testing tools and utilities.

!SLIDE

# test/unit
# RSpec
# Shoulda
# minitest
# bacon
# cucumber
# steak

!SLIDE

# machinist
# fixture scenarios

# sham-rack
# capybara
# _I'm forgetting a lot here!_

!SLIDE

# 

!SLIDE

# There are a _lot_ of places that don't test.
## No, a _lot_.

!SLIDE

# There's a pretty good chance you're working for one.
## But there's a hidden detail...

!SLIDE

# You're all testing
## Just not efficiently.

!SLIDE

# Even big companies with waterfall methodologies have QA Departments.

!SLIDE

# A QA department is just a really inefficient test

!SLIDE

# We made computers to do the boring stuff for us.

!SLIDE

# Automated tests are that boring stuff.
## Checking out is are dotted and ts crossed.

!SLIDE

# We're all scientists
## We're in Computer Science.
## We use the scientific method

!SLIDE

# Start with a hypothesis

!SLIDE

# Come up with a test to prove or disprove it

!SLIDE

# Run it with a control

!SLIDE

# Determine Results

!SLIDE

# ... Profit!

!SLIDE

# The hypothesis states your problem... "I can log in."
## Doesn't sound very exciting, saying it like that.

!SLIDE

# It is, though.
# "The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution." - Bertrand Russell

!SLIDE

# Writing the tests explicitly states a solvable problem and its confirmation.
## This is harder than writing the solution.

!SLIDE

# Running it with a control means watching it fail.
## It's important to know your tests are doing what they say.
## You're testing your tests this way.

!SLIDE

# Make it green, and you have your result.

!SLIDE

# All of this is done the same way whether your autoomate or not.
## Browser tests are still tests.

!SLIDE

# Ok, so we're scientists, but we don't all have great procedures.
## What now?

!SLIDE

# Every scientist worth their salt follows the method
## I would say all programmers do, too.
